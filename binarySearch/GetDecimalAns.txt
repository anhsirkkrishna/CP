To get answer in decimal, you don't need to do like i = start * 1e6 or stuff.
  You just need to run a while loop.
  You don't need to have the condition i < j or something.
  Just run the loop for 100 times.
  Because 2^100 is a very big number.
  So, if we divide the search space by 2 100 times, i would be very precise.

int main() {
	int n,k;
	cin>>n>>k;
	vector<int> v(n);
	for(auto &it: v) cin>>it;
	double s = 0, e = *max_element(v.begin(),v.end());
	
    int x = 100;
    while(x--){
        double mid = (s + e)/2.0;
        if(checker(mid, v,k)){
            s = mid;
        }else{
            e = mid;
        }
    }
    cout <<setprecision(7)<< s <<endl;
	

}
