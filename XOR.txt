XOR properties:
1. ((a ^ b) ^ b) = a
2. a ^ b = b ^ a
3. a ^ 0 = a

Q: Data Structures Fan
This question uses all the properties. This is one of the best question to do.

One implementation is that if we are given 3 numbers and you want odd one out,
just xor the 3 numbers. You will get the odd one out.
