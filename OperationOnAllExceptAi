Let's say we need to do something to all the numbers in the array.
But we don't want to do that for every i once.
Like we need to find the gcd of all the numbers in the array.
But, we want to exclude every element every time.
For that, we do prefix and suffix array.
Like we can make a prefix and suffix array.
Then, we will exclude Ai and find gcd of pref_gcd[i-1] and suff_gcd(i+1).
