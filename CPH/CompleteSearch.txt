-> Generating subsets can be done by 2 ways:
You can make a vector to keep storing the current subset.
But that takes a lot of space.
Instead, you can use binary number to do the same, where the digit would indicate if the bumber is included or not.

-> Generating permutations:
For every i, you can run a loop and one by one select one of the remaining numebrs.

vi permutation = {};
int n = 10;
vb chosen(n);

void search()
{
    if (permutation.size() == n)
    {
        debug(permutation);
    }
    else
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (chosen[i])
                continue;
            chosen[i] = true;
            permutation.push_back(i);
            search();
            chosen[i] = false;
            permutation.pop_back();
        }
    }
}

-> Optimisations:
Even small conditions can reduce the search space by a lot. Like finding the different ways to go from 1 place to another. This is very unoptimised. But with some optimisation, it is very optimised for n = 7.

-> Meet in the middle approach
The meet-in-the-middle technique splits a search space into two roughly equal halves, performs independent searches on each, and combines results efficiently.
It transforms an \(O(2^n)\) problem into \(O(2^{n/2})\) time, which is faster since \(2^{n/2}\) grows much slower than \(2^n\).

### Key Example: Subset Sum Problem
Given a list of \(n\) numbers and target \(x\), check if any subset sums to \(x\).

- **Naive approach**: Generate all \(2^n\) subsets and check sums → \(O(2^n)\) time.
- **Meet-in-the-middle**:
  1. Split list into halves A and B (each ~\(n/2\) elements).
  2. Compute all subset sums for A (\(S_A\), size \(2^{n/2}\)) and B (\(S_B\), size \(2^{n/2}\)).
  3. Sort both lists in \(O(2^{n/2} \log(2^{n/2}))\) time (or use merge-like method).
  4. For each sum \(s\) in \(S_A\), check if \(x - s\) exists in \(S_B\) using binary search → total \(O(2^{n/2})\).

**Illustration**: List , \(x=15\).
- A =  → \(S_A = [0,2,4,6]\)
- B =  → \(S_B = [0,5,9,14]\)
- 6 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 15 → Valid subset .

For \(x=10\), no such pair exists.
