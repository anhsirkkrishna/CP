The problem is easy.
I solved the first part easily.
But I wans't able to think the second part which required some thinking.
I didn't visualise enough.
I could have solved it if I would have used the register more.
But the overall problem was of the level that I could easily solve.

I saw the solution and made half of it by myself. But I kept getting TLE.
The solution was to do the sum from front to back instead of back to front as I was doing initially.
I could have done the whole solution by myself but couldn't because I didn't spend as much time as I should have.
