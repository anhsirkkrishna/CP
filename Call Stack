Because a function has to jump back to the place that called it when it
returns, the computer must remember the context from which the call
happened. In one case, console.log has to return to the greet function
when it is done. In the other case, it returns to the end of the program.
The place where the computer stores this context is the call stack.
Every time a function is called, the current context is stored on top of
this stack. When a function returns, it removes the top context from
the stack and uses that context to continue execution.
Storing this stack requires space in the computer’s memory. When
the stack grows too big, the computer will fail with a message like “out
of stack space” or “too much recursion”.
