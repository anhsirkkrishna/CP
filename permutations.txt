fun permutations: https://codeforces.com/contest/2137/problem/B
In fun permutations, I was doing very complicated stuff, trying to form a permutation by doing some modulo or some shit.
But the real solution was very simple. if the given permutation was 1 3 2, the acceptable permutation was 3 1 2.
The logic was that Bi = len(perm)+1-Ai.
