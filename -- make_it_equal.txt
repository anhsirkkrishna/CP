I wrote the code but it was very time consuming solution and I was getting TLE again and again.
But I used map, unodered map, and many things to make the program more efficient.
Something I could have done is to use ai less and think.
But the problem was so hard that I couldn't.
Still, a big part of creating the code efficient was thought by me not ai which is very good.
