In questions, it sometimes says that your answer might be too big which can lead to integer overflow.
So, you should modulo every variable in that question.
What you should actually do is see which variable is overflowing or can overflow and then apply mod whereever possible.
Basically, it should never overflow.
Mod it on every loop.
Not just the final return.

Like in make it alternating question.
