Incremental Path:
I had a map and I was asking for the key before the upperbound of 'ind + 1'.
But the problem was that when upperbound returned the first element,
previous one doesn't exist. But I was trying to access it.
This thing was handled differently in vs code and codeforces.
In vs code, it gives 0, 0 as the key, value when they don't exist.
While codeforces gives INT_MAX, INT_MAX.
This was making the code give different answer when I was running on vs code,
vs when I was running on codeforces.

Monocarp's String:
If you do *upper_bound larger than the largest element, you get s.end().
In vs code, you get a random integer.
But in CF, it gives the length of the set.
So, keep this in mind.
