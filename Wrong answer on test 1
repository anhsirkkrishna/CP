I had a map and I was asking for the key before the upperbound of 'ind + 1'.
But the problem was that when upperbound returned the first element,
previous one doesn't exist. But I was trying to access it.
This thing was handled differently in vs code and codeforces.
In vs code, it gives 0, 0 as the key, value when they don't exist.
While codeforces gives INT_MAX, INT_MAX.
This was making the code give different answer when I was running on vs code,
vs when I was running on codeforces.
