for i in d:
    if d[i] >= 2:
        print("YES")
        break
else:
    print("NO")
The else here is aligned with for (not with the if),
because in Python, the else after a for or while loop
is executed only if the loop completes normally without
encountering a break. If you indent else under if, it
becomes a conditional part of the if instead of being
associated with the loop, which is incorrect for this
control flow.
